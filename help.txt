List of comands:
--To calculate--
1)U(m, n) - calculate number of permutations without repetition
2)A(m, n) - calculate number of permutations with repetition
3)P(n) - calculate number of permutations without repetition  (where n == m)
4)C(m, n) - calculate number of combinations without repetition
5)S(m, n) - calculate Stirling numbers of the second kind
6)B(n) - calculate Bell number

--Interface--
1)H - help comand
2)Q - to stop program

Points:
1)1st symbol in you input must be comand name
2)The interface is space friendly. So you can enter 
as many spaces as you like, but be sure to follow the syntax.
For instance, "C ( m , n )", "C(m,n)" or "C  (  m  ,  n  )" - is correct.
3)Functions calculates not for all m and n (due to the fact that program use
32-bit numbers, which are limited by 4294967295)
