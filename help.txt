List of comands for program:
--Actions--
1)create "set-name" - create set
2)delete "set-name" - delete set (if exist)

3)addElem "elem-name" "set-name" - add element to set (if exist)
4)deleteElem "elem-name" "set-name" - delete elem from set (if exist)
5)searchElem "elem-name" "set-name" - search elem in set (if exist)

6)cardinality "set-name" - returns cardinaity of set

--Operations with sets--
7)union "set-name1" "set-name2" "res-set-name" - creates union of set1 and set2 
then assigns it to the res-set (if both, set1 and set2 exist)

8)intersection "set-name1" "set-name2" "res-set-name" - creates intersection
of set1 and set2 then assigns it to the res-set (if both, set1 and set2 exist)

9)diff "set-name1" "set-name2" "res-set-name" - creates difference between set1
and set2 then assigns it to the res-set (if both, set1 and set2 exist)

10)symDiff "set-name1"-"set-name2" "res-set-name" - creates symmetrical 
difference between set1 and set2 then assigns it to the res-set (if both, 
set1 and set2 exist)

11)inclusion "set-name1" "set-name2" - print "TRUE" if set2 inlcudes set1 OR 
"FALSE" if does not (if both, set1 and set2 exist)

--Some other stuff--
12)checkSetList - print names of all existing sets OR print "Empty..." if there
are no sets
13)checkSet "set-name" - print all elements in set (if exist) OR print "Empty..."
if there are no elements

Points:
1)To stop program: Ctrl+Z
2)Set name has the same rules as element name
3)If both sets have no elements inclusion returns TRUE
